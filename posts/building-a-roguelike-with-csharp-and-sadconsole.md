I want to convert [Trystan's roguelike tutorial](http://trystans.blogspot.com/) to use C# and SadConsole. Since my C# knowledge is a bit outdated (by nearly a decade) I will update any code when I know better.

I just want to get started building *something* so anything is a good enough start. If you haven't created a basic SadConsole project yet, it would be best to start [here](/posts/getting_started_with_dotnet_core_monogame_and_sadconsole/).

I'm using JetBrains Rider as my IDE. A lot of people use Visual Studio Code, it doesn't really matter what you're using to follow along.

First we'll be starting off with creating a window with some text on it. Let's create a project first.
